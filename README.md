# X230 Hackintosh Catalina
EFI Folder (Clover) and config required to run Thinkpad X230 Hackintosh Catalina 10.15. Files are from @littlegtplr. Added Realtek WLAN kexts (personal preference). Edit config according to your preferences. Suitable for Vanilla approach and SSD hot swap (just replace/paste EFI folder - not recommended though.) 

# What Doesnâ€™t Work?

- Inbuilt WiFi, you can hack BIOS/install a Mac-compatible WiFi card. I highly recommend a external device like Comfast CF-811AC
- Fingerprint reader
