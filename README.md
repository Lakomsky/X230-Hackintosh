# X230 Hackintosh Catalina
EFI Folder (Clover), plist, and BOOT required to run Thinkpad X230 Hackintosh Catalina 10.15. Files are from [@littlegtplr](https://github.com/littlegtplr/Hackintosh-X230-macOS). Move these files to your EFI Folder. I've got another EFI folder labelled **EFI-test**. Feel free to tinker that also. 

Added Realtek WLAN kexts (personal preference). Edit config according to your preferences. Suitable for Vanilla approach and SSD hot swap (just replace/paste EFI folder - not recommended though.) 

# What Doesnâ€™t Work?

- Inbuilt WiFi, you can hack BIOS/install a Mac-compatible WiFi card. I highly recommend a external device like Comfast CF-811AC
- Fingerprint reader
